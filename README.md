## I have no problem if you want to fork this repository to use as your own personal website, I will happily show you how to setup firebase, Formspark (contact form provider) and vercel (used to deploy). I only ask that you give me credit for the ideas taken from this site.

- The project is built in React and utilizes Google Firebase to store data as a content management system (CMS). This allows me to easily update my skills, resume and projects as I am continually learning.
